This is my attempt to resurrect the NovaPunch2 project, which in itself was a merger of parts packs SIDR by NovaSilisko and Wobbly Rockets by SundayPunch.  (Hence “NovaPunch”)  Tiberion carried the merged pack thru until real life requirements caught up to his free time. 

Credits:

  SundayPunch - Original parts
  NovaSilisko - Original parts
  Captain Slug - Original parts
  Omnivore (modeling, math & balancing research)
  Straight Chillen (modeling and configuration)
  Andras (playtesting and engine balance)
  Tiberion (some stuff)
  frizzank (NovaPunch resident artist)
  bac9 (new textures for adapter plates)
  sumghai (Agency logos
  Cpt Kipard (Agency Logos)
  therealcrow999 (Agency Logos)
  Padrone (Updating to KSP 1.2.1)
