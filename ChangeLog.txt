NovaPunch Continued - Padrone

2018 Apr 01 - 0.1.4.4
	Fixed K1 second stage LF/Ox mix.  You'll see a small dv increase in using this tank.
	BUT, you must replace the tank on any exising saved craft or sub-assemblies.

	Thanks to forums user AlonzoTG for bringing that to my attention.

2018 Feb 10 - 0.1.4.3

2017 Dec 05 - 0.1.4.2 
	Certfied for KSP 1.3.1

2017 Jun 19 - 0.1.4.1
	Corrected the AVC file

2017 Jun 18 - 0.1.4.0
	Tightened up spacing between various Odin compoments.  (You shouldn't 
	have to move the pieces closer 	together in the VAB to make it look 
	right)

	Moved several spacing nodes on the Bearcat engines, also to tighten up 
	the spacing.

	Moved all parachutes into the Aero category, moved several docking rings 
	into the Coupling category, moved landing legs/pegs from Utility to 
	Ground, and fine tuned other category entries.

	Renamed several engines to have them show together in the VAB lists.  
	This should not affect any save games/craft.              

	Made a tweaking pass at the example ships and subassemblies.

	Please remember: The landing legs/pegs aren't really useable at this 
	point.  I'm working on learning Blender and such to be able to fix them.

	Also, the next release will remove the fairing mentioned below as being 
	deprecated.

2016 Nov 26 - 0.1.3.0
        NOTICE:  the 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 Fairings are being deprecated.  They're basically 
        heavier, more expensive versions of the stock units.  (To the point they are
        visually identical).  Please retire these parts from use.  They will be dropped
        in a future release.

        Rebalanced the 5m (Sluggo Delta Protective Shell) to match stock mass/cost.

        Recategorization pass: I think everything shows up correctly if you're using
        Filter Exentsions.

        When Remote Tech is present, all Command Modules have a built in short range antenna.
        The CM's have a "Start Deployed/Start Retracted" button.  Deployed by default
        except for the Thor command module.  Also the Thor RCS/Antenna is covered.

        When TAC-LS is present, YawMaster module also has 3 days of supplies for the crew.

        Fixed Freyja built in heatshield issue.

        Tweaked and renamed some of the ship examples.

        Added two sub-assemblies, a Odin Command Module and an Odin/Thor lander set.

2016 Nov 21 - 0.1.2.1
              I managed to leave out the Gamedata\NovaPunch folder from the last version.
              So unless you caught my error, you'll need to look at your Gamedata folder
              and remove any errant folders/files:
                   GameData\Agencies\
                   GameData\Flags\
                   GameData\Parts\
                   GameData\Spaces\
                   GameData\MiniAVC.dll
                   GameData\MiniAVC.xml
                   GameData\NovaPunch.version
              Then you can do the normal install by copying the enclosed \GameData\NovaPunch 
              to the correct place with your other mods.

2016 Nov 20 - 0.1.2
              Shrank both RCS modules to be more in line with other mods/stock
              Intial tagging
              Got the Thor landing legs to animate 
                (but no spring/damper, just indestructable)
              Corrected Credits
              Updated install instructions
              Included removal of Mini-AVC instructions (if you simply must)

2016 Nov 19   0.1.1
              Fixed the forgotten Mini-AVC

2016 Nov 18 - 0.1.0 Alpha release of the NovaPunch Continued.
              Changed some configuration info to bring it up to date for 1.2.1
              Moved some parts around
              Updated the sample craft.  
                (Mostly replaced the fairings with stock procedural fairings.)
                There was some aerodynamic wonkiness going on.
