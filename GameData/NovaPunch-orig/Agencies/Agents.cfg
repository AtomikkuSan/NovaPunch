  description = Silisko Industries is a leader in providing specialized infrastructure for the aerospace industry. It started out as a general aerospace manufacturer and designed several lines of rockets at the dawn of the Kerbal Space Program but later moved on to more niche products such as extra-planetary landing BACE parts, orbital segments and miniaturized equipment for probe and satellite constructs. The company is probably best known for its mysterious leader who strives to remain out of the public eye. His own engineering skill and unwavering vision keeps the company focused on technological progression in the purest of science and exploration, making Silisko Industries not only an industry leader, but a trailblazer.
