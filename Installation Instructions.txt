Remove existing "Gamedata\NovaPunch" folder from previous installs of this version. Do NOT remove \Gamedata, just the subfolder 'NovaPunch".

Open up the downloaded .zip file

Drag and drop the enclosed GameData directory on top of your GameData directory. AKA Merge the GameData in the zip file with your exiting \GameData file.

You should end up with a directory named "NovaPunch" inside \GameData, with all your other mods. You should NOT have \GameData\GameData\NovaPunch. That way lays madness.

Sample Ships:  Open up "Ships" and/or "Subassemblies" inside the zip file, and copy the VAB directory where you need the samples. 


Please Note:

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC. If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version of this mod is available. Data sent out from your PC is limited to the info needed to check the mod version, no personal information is sent. For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the complete KSP-AVC Plugin.

If you don't like using MiniAVC, or already have the full blown installation of AVC, you can go into \GameData\NovaPunch and delete 'Mini-AVC.DLL'.

Personally, I just keep a current copy of the Mini-AVC.DLL in my \GameData and remove it from all mods as I install them.
